老师问完家乡就会问家庭了。

Could you tell us something about your family?What does your family usually do for the weekend?What do you think about living together with your parents?

我用几个问题来作为提示，帮助大家准备这类问题：

⭐Could you tell us something about your family?

Sure. I have a small family of 3: my father, my mother and me. My father is very fond of classic Chinese literature and he teaches Chinese in a local high school. My mother is a warm-hearted person and she has been a nurse for more than 20 years. And I am a fresh college graduate and I am now trying to improve myself by further study in your esteemed institution.

当然 我有一个3口人的小家庭：我的父亲，我的母亲和我。我的父亲非常喜欢中国古典文学，他在当地一所高中教中文。我的妈妈是一个热心人，她做护士已经20多年了。我是一名应届大学毕业生，我现在正努力通过在贵校深造来提高自己。

⭐What does your family usually do for the weekend?

Sometimes we went to the park together on weekends, walking and talking. We enjoy sharing our stories and interesting anecdotes with each other and it’s a great opportunity for us to know each other better. While we are the family, the communication is very important. Sometimes, we would go on our separate ways and spend time on hobbies or with friends. We have both shared and different interests. The diversity is the feature of our family.

有时我们在周末一起去公园散步和聊天。我们喜欢彼此分享我们的故事和有趣的轶事，这对我们增进彼此了解是一个很好的机会，虽然我们是一家人，但是交流也是很有必要的。有时，我们会走自己的路，花时间在兴趣爱好或与朋友上。我们有共同的兴趣，也有不同的兴趣。多样性真的是我们家庭的特色。

🎁今天的问题：

Do you have any hobbies?How did you become interested in the hobbies?

我给大家一个参考答案：

⭐Do you have any hobbies?

Yes,I love reading books. Watching movies and playing basketball. It motivates me when I am depressed. It comforts me when I am distressed.It makes me happy when I am sad.It gives me directions when I am confused and lost.It gives me courage when I am scared.

你有什么爱好吗？

是的，我喜欢读书。看电影和打篮球。它激励着我，当我沮丧的时候。在我痛苦的时候，它安慰我。当我难过的时候，它让我快乐。当我困惑和迷失时，它给我方向。当我害怕时，它给我勇气。

⭐How did you become interested in the hobbies?

I love to do sports in my spare time, long-distance running in particular. I began running at the advice of a doctor, who says that my back pain can never be cured unless I use my muscles. The beginning is difficult, but after I had run my first 10 km, I become literally addicted to the feeling of constantly pushing limits, no matter how small the progress might be.

你是如何开始对爱好感兴趣的？

我喜欢在业馀时间做运动，尤其是长跑。我听从医生的建议开始跑步，医生说我的背痛除非锻炼我的肌肉，否则无法治愈。开始是困难的，但在我跑完我的第一个10公里之后，我真的开始沉迷于不断挑战极限的感觉，不管进步有多小。
